The visually colourful images portray the cow as a sensitive creature worthy of admiration.",
    "Directors_Note": "With my film I want to make a positive contribution to the current situation. I would like the film to be an impulse to reflect on the life of an animal - in this case a cow - to draw attention to the need to see each creature as a complex, living being, not just as part of our human economic industry. I work freely with facts. I collected these for about a year and a half from the media, books and narratives, gathering a lot of bizarre, common or biological facts about cows.",

    "Directors_Note": "I drew inspiration for First Patrol from a 2015 tragedy in the South Moravian town of Uherský Brod, Czech Republic – the country’s first mass shooting. The title reflects both the officers’ arrival as the first patrol and Czech society’s first encounter with such violence. My intention was never a reconstruction, but a fictional immersive journey that places us in the patrol car and uniform of the first responders, who are both the earliest witnesses to such horrors and, above all, human beings.",

As the story unfolds, power proves decentralized—internalized and reproduced by individuals themselves. Inspired by my own experience in a corporate office, the film uses the metaphor of “hats” to represent the roles we adopt until the protagonist chooses to break free by taking his off.",

    "Synopsis": "A disgraced justice minister meets an ambitious young woman on a delayed train to Prague. Their unlikely bond deepens over one surreal night filled with hidden lovers, unexpected truths, and a drunken dance of reckoning, as both confront ambition, loneliness, and the need for connection.",
    "Directors_Note": "Return explores the unraveling of a powerful woman after a political downfall. I'm drawn to layered characters and contradictions—especially women in power and how they’re judged differently than men. The film shifts tone and setting to reflect Patricie’s inner descent, using stylized visuals and dynamic camera work to mirror her instability, loneliness, and vulnerability. At its core, it’s about communication breakdown and the clash of ideals.",

When a local crane operator is hired to do the job, the giant vegetable turns violent and destructive.

Inspired by the classic Czech tale The Big Beetroot, we reimagine the beet as an uncontrollable force, merging fairy tale with the Japanese Kaiju genre. As the beet grows, so do the problems—nature's power takes monstrous form.",
