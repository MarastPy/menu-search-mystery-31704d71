A mosaic of small stories in which cows experience positive and negative moments, depicts the life of an animal in a global world and its relationship with humans. The visually colourful images portray the cow as a sensitive creature worthy of admiration.",
    "Directors_Note": "With my film, I aim to offer a positive contribution to the climate debate by encouraging reflection on the life of an animal—here, a cow—and the need to see every creature as a complex being, not just part of an economic system. Though based on facts I gathered over a year and a half, the film isn’t meant as radical or purely documentary. Using animated collage, I tell cow stories from around the world in a playful, distanced way, showing how a cow’s life can mirror the world itself.",

Their forbidden bond awakens Thunder’s wrath, shattering her amber palace, but not their love - from its tears, Baltic amber is born.",
    "Directors_Note": "As a creator, I’m drawn to the fragility and power of love. In Amber Tale, the sea goddess’s devotion to a mortal embodies this paradox: her sacrifice, transforming into amber to protect him, is both defeat and transcendence. The film’s visual language reflects amber’s warmth, transparency, and texture, like viewing ancient jewelry under magnification — revealing trapped light, emotion, time, and myth.",

The girl turns inward, and the unspoken hurt shapes their relationship over the years—until time offers a fragile chance for reconnection.",

To immerse viewers in memory, I used a handheld feel, close-ups, low depth of field, and motion for immediacy. I painted the puppets’ eyes directly, giving them life and an intense expression of their emotions.",

Their umbrage makes them inflate like balloons, they fly all the way up to the clouds. Girls get stuck up there, with no idea how to get down and save their kitten stuck in the tree.",
    "Directors_Note": "A person learns how to forgive all of his life, even though he encounters this concept early in his childhood. The saying“to forgive is divine”always rings true, even if it is sometimes difficult. And for small children, it is even more complicated, because they are just learning how to deal with their emotions. I am a mother of two little girls and I quickly found out how difficult it is sometimes, to explain basic behavioral patterns. That is why I decided to make this film.",

Despite being professionals, the two colleagues are afraid, disagree about how to proceed, and make mistakes.",
    "Directors_Note": "I drew inspiration for First Patrol from the 2015 tragedy in Uherský Brod, the Czech Republic’s first mass shooting. The title reflects both the officers’ arrival as the first patrol and Czech society’s first encounter with such violence. Rather than a reconstruction, the film offers an immersive journey placing us in the patrol car with first responders, who witness the horror yet remain human above all.",

The film conveys the child's bodily experience on screen, drawing inspiration from the real childhood memories of four adults.",

I wanted the animation to convey how they felt at home as children. The expressive nature of charcoal helped me emphasize the subjective perspective of the child protagonist. I wanted to capture the fear they encountered every day and their need to escape from a dysfunctional home during difficult moments – whether mentally or physically.",

As the story unfolds, power proves decentralized—internalized and reproduced by individuals themselves.

Right after reminding you of what bothers you about people, it showcases all the things you can't do to them in reality. I see this film as a form of therapy, allowing me to creatively explore these unpleasant emotions and not keep them bottled up inside. Instead of silently hating each other, we can laugh and perhaps reflect on how loudly we are munching our popcorn.",

It is hard for me to recall the chronology of those days, my mind blocks and minimizes all the memories, erases them, but the only thing I know for sure is that every day everything rapidly became worse.",

But reliving the trauma of occupation and abusive relationships made me stronger. With this film I carry a clear message: The culprit must be punished. It’s always the rapist’s fault. Stop the Russian war against Ukraine.",

    "Synopsis": "A disgraced justice minister meets an ambitious young woman on a delayed train to Prague. Their unlikely bond deepens over one surreal night filled with hidden lovers, unexpected truths, and a drunken dance of reckoning, as both confront ambition, loneliness, and the need for connection.",
    "Directors_Note": "Return explores the unraveling of a powerful woman after a political downfall. I'm drawn to layered characters and contradictions—especially women in power and how they’re judged differently than men. The film shifts tone and setting to reflect Patricie’s inner descent, using stylized visuals and dynamic camera work to mirror her instability, loneliness, and vulnerability. At its core, it’s about communication breakdown and the clash of ideals.",

    "Logline": "Volklore weaves Czech folklore traditions with fashion’s milestones, tracing seasons in the rhythm of consumerism.",
    "Synopsis": "Volklore, an experimental video essay exploring how Czech folklore transforms in the digital age of social networks. Traditions become tools for marketing; you become a brand, your followers a community. YouTuber Vivi guides us through folk customs linking them to key fashion events. But is there authenticity in the age of platform capitalism?",
    "Directors_Note": "I created Volklore out of a personal need to bring Moravian folklore into its contemporary context. The film treats folklore as a living form of cultural expression rather than a relic. It shows how traditions are reshaped by social values and markets. Through a YouTube vlog, the film explores the digital reality of Generation Z, where advertising becomes a new form of folk storytelling. My goal is not to romanticize, but to reveal an online reality that is becoming increasingly common.",

From sea waves and wind-shaped grass to shock waves, protests, grief, borders crossed, passion, joy, birth and death.

A story about childlike play, chaos, perfectionism, about the creator’s lot and the acceptance of flaws. Most importantly, it is the story of two characters who find a way to accept each other in spite of their differences, and thanks to this, are able to set themselves free.",
